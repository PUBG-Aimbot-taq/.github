## Overview

PUBG’s “Fog of War” Anti-ESP erases data for out-of-sight players, blocking most wallhack overlays. Our code grabs post-projection memory, side-stepping that smokescreen with ease. 
Signature randomization on every launch mimics legit DLL hashes, so heuristic scans shrug and move on.
